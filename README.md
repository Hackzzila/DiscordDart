## Why nyx?

### Cross Platform
nyx works on the command line, browser, mobile, and can be transpiled to JavaScript.

### Fine Control
nyx allows you to control every outgoing HTTP request or websocket messages.

### Internal Sharding
nyx automatically spawns shards for your bot, but you can override this and spawn a custom
number of shards. Internal sharding means that all of your bots servers are managed in one script,
no need for communication between shards.
